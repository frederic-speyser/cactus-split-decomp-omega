growth_rate_omega.py

Estimates rho_Omega directly from the exact rational coefficients
computed by mgonal_cactus_series_omega.py, via a coefficient-ratio test
-- a method entirely independent of critical_point_omega.py, which
instead solves the criticality condition Phi_y(rho,tau)=1 numerically by
bisection on a double-precision series evaluation.

The two methods share no code path: this one works from exact integer
coefficients (fractions.Fraction, via mgonal_cactus_series_omega.py) and
a plain ratio of consecutive non-zero terms; critical_point_omega.py
works from a double-precision truncated series and an analytic
criticality condition. Agreement between the two is a genuine
cross-check, not a restatement of the same computation.

Caveat, inherited from the pure-m case and worth restating here: for a
periodic support (single m), the raw ratio test needs many terms to
settle, because of the n^(-3/2) sub-exponential correction. For mixed
Omega the support is aperiodic almost immediately (see the aperiodicity
argument sketched in [1]'s conclusion, and confirmed computationally in
this repository's first entries), so consecutive non-zero terms are
available from very early on -- but the same n^(-3/2) correction still
means the raw ratio converges to 1/rho_Omega only slowly, from above.
